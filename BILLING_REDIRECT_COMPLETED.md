# Billing Route Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary
The billing page (https://cricketstatspack.com/billing) has been successfully updated to redirect premium users directly to Stripe's Customer Portal for billing management instead of showing an internal billing template.

## What the New Billing Route Does

### 1. **User Authentication Check**
- Checks if user is logged in via session
- Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated

### 2. **Premium Status & Stripe Customer ID Lookup**
- Queries database for user's premium status and Stripe customer ID
- Redirects non-premium users to `/profile` page
- Only premium users can access billing management

### 3. **Stripe Customer Portal Redirect**
- **If user has Stripe customer ID**: Creates portal session and redirects immediately
- **If no customer ID stored**: Searches Stripe by email, updates database if found, then redirects
- **If no Stripe customer found**: Redirects to `/subscribe` to set up billing

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Catches Stripe API errors and shows user-friendly error page
- Catches database errors and redirects to profile
- Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

## User Experience

### Premium Users with Active Subscriptions
1. Click "Manage Subscription" on profile page
2. Get redirected to `/billing`
3. **Automatically redirected to Stripe Customer Portal** where they can:
   - **Cancel their subscription**
   - **Update payment methods** (credit cards, etc.)
   - **Download invoices** (PDF format)
   - **View billing history**
   - **Update billing address**
   - **Switch between monthly/annual plans** (if configured)

### Premium Users without Stripe Setup
- Redirected to `/subscribe` to complete billing setup

### Non-Premium Users
- Redirected to `/profile` page (billing not accessible)

## Key Benefits
